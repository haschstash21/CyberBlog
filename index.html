                <h3>The Risks of Public Wi-Fi</h3>
                <h4>Hotspots and Unsecured Wi-Fi</h4>
                <p>Our world has been more connected than ever before, and with the need for mobility and constant access to that world, 
Public Wi-Fi and Hotspots have become a necessity for most people and businesses.  But what are the dangers of connecting 
to these unsecured networks?</p>

		<p>Cybercriminals use a combination of technical know-how and free tools to sneak into unsecured networks and steal 
sensitive information. This could include passwords, banking information, or personal data that can be used for identity
theft.  Attacks such as packet sniffing and Man-in-the-middle are used by hackers to get access to personal information
in order to steal your identity or access your bank accounts. </p>

		<p>Other risks include malware attacks that are disruptive to lives and businesses, such as ransomware attacks and gaining 
remote access to your device that can be triggered by the bad actor at any time.</p>

		<p>Some security steps that you can take to mitigate these risks before, during and after connecting to public wi-fis are: 
		   <ol>
		        1. Turn on your VPN before connecting<br>
			2. Make sure your antivirus is up and running <br>
			3. Log out of any account you don't need to use while connected. <br>
			4. Avoid filling in sensitive information such as passwords or personal details. <br>
			5. Scan your device for malware after disconnecting. <br>
			6. Restart your device to help sever any connections to a potential hacker. <br>
			7. Purge any networks you don't need from your preferred network list. 
		   </ol>
                </p>
		<p>In summary, connecting to mobile hotspots and public Wi-Fi are just part of life whether it be for personal or business
		   needs.  If you can avoid connecting to an unsecured network, it's highly advised but there are security measures
		   you can easily follow to help prevent your data from getting into the wrong hands!

                <h3>What is a Honeypot?</h3>
                <h4>Network Security</h4>
                <p>Whenever I hear the term <q>honeypot</q>, I immediately think of Winnie the Pooh with his head stuck in the honey jar! But what 
		   does Winnie the Pooh and Network Security have to do with each other?</p>

		<p>A honeypot is essentially a network-attached system used as a decoy to lure cyber attackers to detect, deflect and study 
		   hacking attempts.  It represents itself on the internet as a potential target, usually a server or high-value asset, and 
		   gathers information to notify defenders of attempts to access the honeypot by unauthorized users.</p>

		<p>Honeypot systems use hardened operating systems with extra security measures to minimize their exposure to threats and 
		   are typically placed within DMZ zones on a network to keep them isolated from the production network.  They are configured 
		   to appear to have exploitable vulnerabilities.  For example, a honeypot system might appear to respond to Server Message 
		   Block (SMB) protocol requests which was used by the <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/WannaCry-ransomware?Offer=abMeterCharCount_var1">WannaCry ransomware</a>
		   attack and represent itself as an enterprise database server.</p>

		<p>The benefits of honeypots include can include real data collection from actual attacks that give cybersecurity analysts lots of
		   useful information.  Fewer false positives when it comes to generated alerts, since legitimate users have no reason to access 
		   the honeypot. Encryption circumvention, meaning a honeypot will still capture malicious activity, even if an attacker is using
		   encryption.</p> 

		<p>Some of the disadvantages are limited data as honeypots only collect information when an attack occurs.  They are set up on an
		   isolated network so if attackers suspect a network is a honeypot, they will avoid it.  Experienced hackers can often differentiate
		   a production system from a decoy.</p> 

		<p>The cost of maintaining a honeypot can be high, due to specialized skills to implement and administer a system as a decoy,
		   while also preventing attackers from gaining access to any production systems.  The cost of not having a honeypot implemented
		   properly could be even higher however if a bad actor gains full root access to your systems.</p> 

		<p>My final thought will be a question for you out there, are honeypots worth the expense? Let me know your thoughts.</p>
